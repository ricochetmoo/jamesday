	<p>Hey {{$first_name}},</p>

	<p>I've been told I probably should have mentioned that the venue is outside... There's shelter in case it rains and a fire as well.</p>

	<p>Access to the venue is from Kings Dock Street, just off The Strand/Wapping. The entrance is at <a href="https://w3w.co/tiny.famed.plus">///tiny.famed.plus</a> (<a href="">92X8+4R Liverpool</a>).</p>

	<p><b>There is no dress code</b> and the start time has been changed to any time from 18:00 to make the most of the sunlight!</p>

	<p>Cheers,<br>James</p>
