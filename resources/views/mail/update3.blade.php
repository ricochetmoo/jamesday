	<h1 class="text-align:center;font-size:2.5em;font-weight:bold">Thanks for coming to Jamesday!</h1>

	<p>Hey {{$first_name}},</p>

	<p>Firstly, a huge thank you to everyone who came to the event and made it such a memorable night. I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did.</p>

	<p>If you didn't notice, Bee spent a lot of the evening taking photos which are now available on <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/5Cn8k525qkCwnxPN8" target="_blank">The Jamesday Celebrations 2022 Google Photos Shared Album</a>, which you can add your own photos too as well. Thank you Bee for taking these and editing them so quickly!</p>

	<p>Finally, I did promise some very exclusive Jamesday badges, perfect for your camp blanket, and you can now let me know if you'd like one of these on the Jamesday website (they're free, with UK postage available at Â£1). You'll need to let me know by <b>Friday 31/06/2022 23:59</b> if you want one. You can log in to the website (once, you'll need to generate a new link at <a href="https://day.jamesbarber.tech/" target="_blank">day.jamesbarber.tech</a> any other times) using the link below:</p>

	<p>You can log in to the system using this magic link: <a href="{{url('/')}}/auth/token/{{$token}}">{{url('/')}}/auth/token/{{$token}}</a></p>

	<p>Cheers,<br>James</p>
